# Meal Search Web App

I've Updated My favourite meals but from a creative perspective i gave it on the same page so that user should know what he is making favorite as he goes through the meal.

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for meals by name and view details about each meal, including its ingredients, instructions, and a link to a YouTube video (if available). The app uses the MealDB API to fetch meal data.
